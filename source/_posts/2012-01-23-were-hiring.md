## Essential Knowledge

  * HTML5. Semantic markup patterns for flexible reuse.
  * CSS. Good understanding of modern techniques such as font-embedding and transitions, graceful degradation for older browsers.
  * LESS/SASS. Creating [DRY CSS](http://blog.responsivenews.co.uk/blog/2011/11/08/responsive-css-that-scales/) patterns to improve design consistency and flexibility.
  * JAVASCRIPT. Excellent JavaScript programming skills, with knowledge of developing large, modular applications.
  * DESIGN AWARE. Doesn't need to be a 'designer' as such, but a good understanding of design principles (information structure, brand consistency, eye for detail) and experience of working closely with designers is essential. Will be directly responsible for the quality of the product interface, so being able to confidently discuss and understand the principles and aims of the product is really important.
  * UX. Good understanding (preferably some experience) of wireframes, user-flow diagrams, content-strategy documentation. Won't be producing these documents, but it's likely (and preferable) that you will be involved at this stage of the design process. Ability to discuss the software implications of design decisions.
  * RESPONSIVE DESIGN. Creating interfaces and [content architectures](http://blog.responsivenews.co.uk/blog/2011/11/11/axes-of-responsive-design/) that work on both desktop and mobile screens.
  * CLIENT-SIDE PERFORMANCE. Understanding of how HTML/CSS techniques can affect page performance, in both modern and legacy browsers.
  * ENGINEERING TOOLS. Experience of version control tools, continuous integration and [automated build/test systems](https://github.com/bbc) would be an advantage.
  * STRATEGIC THINKING. Interested in balancing the (sometimes conflicting) requirements of iterative products built on top of a long-lifespan platform.
